Example config to be placed in settings.json
```
  "ep_oauth":{
    "clientID": "9829038409234fuckingnumbersandl1e1tt1er1s111yo",
    "clientSecret": "herpderp22",
    "callbackURL": "http://etherpoop.com:9001/auth/callback"
  }
```

Note that we currently only support Github, we need better logic for events to fire after succesful Auth IE what user data to grab
